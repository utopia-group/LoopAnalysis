/* contract CobeFriendCore { */&#13;
    // This is the main CobeFriends contract. In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,&#13;
    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts&#13;
    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are&#13;
    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping&#13;
    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks&#13;
    // CobeFriend ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of&#13;
    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.&#13;
    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!&#13;
    //&#13;
    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major&#13;
    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still&#13;
    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core&#13;
    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus&#13;
    //             internal functions for managing these items.&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations&#13;
    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token&#13;
    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed CobeFriends together, including&#13;
    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on CobeFriends or siring&#13;
    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one&#13;
    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated&#13;
    //             through this facet of the core contract.&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - CobeFriendMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 CobeFriends.&#13;
    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" CobeFriends that can be given away (especially important when&#13;
    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up&#13;
    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they&#13;
    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 2400*12*12 gen0 CobeFriends. After that, it's all up to the&#13;
    //             community to breed, breed, breed!&#13;
