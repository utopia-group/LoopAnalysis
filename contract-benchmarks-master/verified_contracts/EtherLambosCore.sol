    // facet of functionality of EtherLambos. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still&#13;
    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:&#13;

    //      - EtherLambosBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core&#13;
    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus&#13;
    //             internal functions for managing these items.&#13;

    //      - EtherLambosAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations&#13;
    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - EtherLambosOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token&#13;
    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).&#13;
    //&#13;
    //      - EtherLambosSale: Here we have the public methods for sales. &#13;
